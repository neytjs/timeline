Timeline is a special purpose text editor made with Electron, React, and NeDB. It can be used as an analytical diary and research tool. Insert entries about interesting events into your Timeline and then use the appâ€™s line charts to analyze event significance over time. Entries can also be organized by dates and tags, making Timeline something like an offline blog. The app also offers a search feature for researching specific events in your file.

To install you will need node/npm, webpack, and electron-packager. Once you have downloaded and navigated to this directory, simply run npm install, webpack, and then electron-packager. Linux users can also download a fully installed version of Timeline, available in releases. If you can not double click launch the Linux executable, you can always start it from a terminal.
